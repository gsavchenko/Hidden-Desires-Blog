# Hidden-Desires-Blog Changelog

Blog site using JSF

1. I added the new blogsite zip file to the repo which contains:
  	- updated version of the site 
  	- user can input text in the blob field and submit the apporpriate password to submit their blog statement 
  	- the user's info will be check in the database as well as the users post
  
2. Fixed up repo
	- merged changes to root
	- changing Kevin's BlogSite.zip to backup.zip cause that makes a little more sense
